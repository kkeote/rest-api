Review your output and logs.  **Google any errors**
Try to install in a different way.  Try some potential solutions.

For Node 4 onwards, you need a compiler with C++11 support.

Did the error indicate a network connection issue?  Do you need to set `http_proxy`?

Try running `npm cache clean` and deleting the `node_modules/oracledb` directory.

Do you have an old version of `node-gyp` installed?  Try updating it.  Also try deleting `$HOME/.node-gyp` or equivalent.

#### Answer the following questions:

1. What error(s) you are seeing?

2. What *exact* command caused the problem (e.g. what command did you try to install with)?  Who were you logged in as?

3. What environment variables did you set?  How *exactly* did you set them?

4. What is your version of Node.js?

5. What is your version of the Oracle client (e.g. Instant Client)?  How was it installed?  Where it is installed?

6. What is your OS and version?

7. What compiler version did you use?  For example, with GCC, run `gcc --version`
