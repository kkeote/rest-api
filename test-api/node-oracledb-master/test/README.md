The node-oracledb test suite uses 'mocha', 'should' and 'async'.  See
[LICENSE](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
for relevant licenses.

## 1. Preparations for running tests

See [INSTALL](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
for installation requirements and more details.

Note: the
[test suite](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/tree/master/test)
is in GitHub.  From node-oracledb 1.9.1 it is not included when
installing from npmjs.com with `npm install oracledb`.

### 1.1 Create a working directory

```
mkdir <some-directory>
cd <some-directory>
```

### 1.2 Get node-oracledb from GitHub

Clone the project repository:

```
cd <some-directory>
git clone https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb.git
```

### 1.3 Build

```
cd <some-directory>/node-oracledb
npm install
```

Running `npm install` within the node-oracledb/ directory will recompile
oracledb and install all its dependent modules.  These are listed
in the `devDependencies` field of `package.json` file.  Thus, 'mocha', 'async'
and 'should' modules are installed by this command.

The test suite uses [mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha),
[async](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async) and
[should](https://www.npmjs.com/package/should).

### 1.4 Configure Database credentials

The database credentials for node-oracledb test suite are defined in `dbconfig.js`.
They can also be set via environment variables shown in that file.


```
vi <some-directory>/node-oracledb/test/dbconfig.js
```

```javascript
module.exports = {
  user          : process.env.NODE_ORACLEDB_USER || "hr",
  password      : process.env.NODE_ORACLEDB_PASSWORD || "welcome",
  connectString : process.env.NODE_ORACLEDB_CONNECTIONSTRING || "localhost/orcl"
};
```

To enable external authentication tests, please make sure Oracle Database
and the authentication service have been appropriately configured.  See
[Documentation for External Authentication](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/doc/api.md#extauth)
for more details. And then, set the environment variable `NODE_ORACLEDB_EXTERNALAUTH`
to be `true`.

Note: the test suite requires a schema with these privileges:

- CREATE TABLE
- CREATE SESSION
- CREATE PROCEDURE
- CREATE SEQUENCE
- CREATE TRIGGER

### 1.5 Set NODE_PATH

```bash
export NODE_PATH=<some-directory>/node-oracledb/lib
```

## 2. Run tests

### 2.1 Run the complete test suite

#### 2.1.1 On Unix-like systems

```
cd <some-directory>/node-oracledb
npm test
```

This calls the `test` script defined in `oracledb/package.json`.

#### 2.1.2 On Windows

```
cd <some-directory>/node_oracledb
npm run testwindows
```

This calls the `testwindows` script defined in `oracledb/package.json`.

See [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) for more information
about how npm handles the "scripts" field of `package.json`.

### 2.2 Run specified test(s)

```
cd <some-directory>/node_oracledb
<mocha-executable-file-directory>/mocha test/<test-names>
```

See [mochajs.org](http://mochajs.org/) for more information on running tests with mocha.

## 3. Add Tests

See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for general information on contribution requirements.

For easy correlation between results and test code, each test is
assigned a number. The following number ranges have been chosen:

- 1  - 20  are reserved for basic functional tests
- 21 - 50  are reserved for data type supporting tests
- 51 onwards are for other tests

In order to include your tests in the suite, add each new test file
name to [`test/opts/mocha.opts`](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/test/opts/mocha.opts).

Please also add a description of each individual test to the Test
List.

## 4. Test List

See [`test/list.txt`](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/test/list.txt)
for the list of existing tests.

## 5. Tests Compatibility

- We conduct base testing with Instant Client 11.2.0.4 and 12.1.0.2 on Linux X64
and Windows 7.

- Users of 11.2.0.1 and 11.2.0.2 clients may see failures with poolTimeout.js
and dataTypeDouble.js.

- Slow networks may cause some tests to timeout.

## 6. Troubleshooting

You may encounter some troubles when running the test suite. These troubles
might be caused by the concurrency issue of Mocha framework, network latencies,
or database server issues. This section gives some issues that we ever saw
and our solutions.

### 6.1 ORA-00054: resource busy and acquire with NOWAIT specified or timeout expired

This error occurs when Node.js programs try to change database objects which
hold locks. The workaround would be:

(1) Use unique DB object names for each test to avoid interference between
test files.
(2) Try not to use 'beforeEach' blocks for object operations to avoid
the interference between cases.

### 6.2 ORA-00018: maximum number of sessions exceeded

This error occurs when the test suite takes up more sessions than the
configured limit. You can alter the session limit on the database server side.
If you do not have access to change the database session setting, you could
use the below script to deliberately add an interval between tests.

```Bash
arr=$(ls test/*js)
for case in ${arr[@]}
do
  var="$NODE_PATH/../node_modules/.bin/mocha --timeout 10000 $case"
  eval $var
  sleep 1
done
```

### 6.3 ORA-28865: SSL connection closed

You may encounter this error when the test suite sends more connection
requests per second than the database is configured to handle.

There are two solutions:

- Solution 1: Change database `RATE_LIMIT` configuration. This parameter
defines the connection count allowed per second. See [RATE_LIMIT](https://docs.oracle.com/database/122/NETRF/Oracle-Net-Listener-parameters-in-listener-ora-file.htm#NETRF426)
for more information.

- Solution 2: Set the `RETRY_COUNT` and `RETRY_DELAY` parameters in
connectString.

For example, below is the connectString which could be defined in
`tnsnames.ora` file.

```
dbaccess = (description=(RETRY_COUNT=20)(RETRY_DELAY=3)
          (address=(protocol=tcps)(port=1521)(host=<db-host>))
          (connect_data=(service_name=<service-name>))
          (security=(my_wallet_directory=<wallet-location>)(ssl_server_cert_dn=<ssl-server-cert-dn>))
       )
```
